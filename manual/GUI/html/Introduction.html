							<h3>General Information</h3>
							<p>The core of RNAstructure is a dynamic programming algorithm to predict RNA or DNA secondary structures from sequence based on the principle of minimizing free energy. The <a href="http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/NNDB/">thermodynamic parameters</a> used for RNA predictions are the latest available from the Turner laboratory. Several modules are provided to extend the capabilities of secondary structure prediction, including the prediction of a secondary structure common to two sequences, and to make this a user-friendly RNA folding program.</p>
							<p>RNAstructure was originally written by David H. Mathews for Isis Pharmaceuticals and is made available for the RNA community by Isis. RNAstructure is now supported by U.S. National Institutes of Health grant #R01GM076485. It is available on <a href="http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu">the Mathews Lab Homepage</a>.</p>
							<p>Two other modern implementations of the dynamic programming algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction are <a href="http://bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/~zukerm">mfold/UNAfold</a>, available on the World Wide Web at Michael Zuker's homepage, and the <a href="http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA">Vienna RNA package</a>, maintained by Ivo Hofacker. The implementation of the thermodynamic parameters differs in multibranch and exterior loops, therefore some differences in the predicted lowest free energy structures are expected by different packages.</p>
							<p>Research benefitting from this program should cite the journal references on which this program is based (See "<a href="References.html">References</a>").</p>

							<h3><a name="Requirements" id="Requirements">Requirements</a></h3>
							<p>RNAstructure can be run on Windows, Macintosh, or Linux systems.</p>
							<p>On the Macintosh and on Linux, the program requires Java version 1.6 or higher. For best results, the implementation of Java obtained directly from Sun Microsystems should be used. Other implementations may cause aberrant behavior. The Sun implementation of Java can be found at <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">the Java download pages</a>.</p>
