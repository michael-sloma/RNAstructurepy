<html><body>
A package that encapsulates all the Java classes that comprise the RNAstructure Java interface.
<br/><br/>
There are no classes in this package.
Instead, all Java interface classes are in the subpackages of this one.
This is because the interface is backed by C++ classes, and these C++ classes are separated from the Java classes in the RNAstructure_java_interface folder.
C++ classes cannot be documented with Javadocs, but are documented with Doxygen formatting.
