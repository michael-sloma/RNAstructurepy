						<p>David Mathews wrote many of the original components, the Windows GUI, and the first components of the class library.</p>
						<p>Stas Bellaousov contributed to ProbKnot.</p>
						<p>Stas Bellaousov, Wayne Huggins, and Christine Hajdin wrote ShapeKnots.				    </p>
				    <p>Rhiju Das and Pablo Cordero contributed the ability of efn2 to use SHAPE data and the ability to apply pairing energy restraints in Fold. Additionally, they contributed a knowledge-based method for determining stacking restraints from chemical mapping data.</p>
						<p>Laura DiChiacchio wrote the DuplexFold algorithm.</p>
						<p>Yinghan Fu wrote Multifind and revised Dynalign to make Dynalign II.</p>
					  <p>Jason Gloor wrote the first implementation of MaxExpect.</p>
						<p>Arif Harmanci wrote PARTS, TurboFold, and the pairwise alignment HMM.</p>
						<p>Jim Hart wrote NAPSS.</p>
						<p>Joshua Keegan wrote the first configuration file implementation, used by Dynalign, PARTS, TurboFold, and Multilign.</p>
						<p>John Lu extended OligoWalk, wrote the OligoWalk command line interface, added the O(N^3) code for predicting internal loops of any size in free energy minimization and the partition function, and wrote the OligoWalk web server.</p>
						<p>Jacob Mainzer wrote the extended_double type and added single-stranded SHAPE constraints to free energy minimization.</p>
						<p>Michael Sloma wrote many of the SMP versions of the programs, with contributions by David Mathews. Michael also wrote the interface to phmm.</p>
				    <p>Jessica Reuter wrote the JAVA GUI, the Makefile system, CircleCompare and most of the command line interfaces.</p>
						<p>Harry Stern wrote partition-cuda.</p>
					  <p>Paul Tymann, Glenn Katzen, Chris Connett, and Andrew Yohn, Computer Science, Rochester Institute of Technology, contributed changes that accelerated Dynalign and also wrote the SMP version of Dynalign.</p>
					  <p>Kevin Weeks and Katie Deigan contributed to the methods for using SHAPE data to restrain secondary structure prediction.</p>
					  <p>Kevin Weeks and Christine Hajdin contributed to the design of CircleCompare.</p>
					  <p>Kevin Weeks, Christine Hajdin, and Stas Bellaousov determined the energy function and best parameters used in ShapeKnots.</p>
						<p>Zhenjiang Xu wrote the Multilign algorithm.</p>
