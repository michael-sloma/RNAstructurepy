							This page only gives details on how to install the package.
							For information on how to build the package, please refer to the <a href="Building.html">Building Instructions</a> and <a href="Building_Requirements.html">Building Requirements</a> pages.
						<p>

						<h3>To install the graphical user interface (GUI), follow these steps:</h3>
                        <ol>
							<li>Download the Windows GUI from <a href="http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html">the Mathews Lab RNAstructure page</a>. See the note below if you are not sure about whether to use 32-bit or 64-bit.<br>
							</li>
							<li>Double-click the zipped package to view the contents.</li>
							<li>Double-click setup.exe and use the Windows installer to install the package.</li>
							<li>RNAstructure can now be started from the Start menu.</li>
							<li>The complete manual for the GUI can be found <a href="../GUI/html/Contents.html">here</a>. It can also be found under the help menu item within the program.</li>
						</ol>
      <h3>Special note about Example Files:</h3>
                        <p>The example files that come with RNAstructure will be installed in your user data folder in a new folder called RNAstructure_examples. This is &quot;My Documents&quot; on Windows XP and &quot;Documents&quot; on Windows 7 and Windows 8. <br>
                        </p>
<h3>To install the text interfaces, follow these steps:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Download the text interfaces for Windows from <a href="http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html">the Mathews Lab RNAstructure page</a>. See the note below if you are not sure about whether to use 32-bit or 64-bit.</li>
							<li>Extract the files from the zipped package by double-clicking and dragging the contents to the desired location.</li>
							<li>Specify the DATAPATH environment variable as explained <a href="../Text/Thermodynamics.html">here</a>.</li>
							<li>The executables are in the exe folder.</li>
							<li>Note that the -smp versions of programs (for parallel processing) also rely on libiomp5.dll, which is provided in the exe directory. It needs to be in the same directory a the -smp exe.</li>
							<li>The complete manual for using the text interfaces is available<a href="../Text/index.html"> here</a>.					</li>
						</ol>
					  <h3>A Note about 32-bit and 64-bit:</h3>
					<p>The 32-bit verions will work on either 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows. The 64-bit will only work on 64-bit versions of Windows. The 64-bit version of RNAstructure can address more memory, and hence longer sequences can be analyzed using the 64-bit version. For the GUI, the 64-bit installer will stop if you have a 32-bit version of Windows.</p>
					<p>If you are not sure which version to download because you do not know what version of Windows you have, the 32-bit is a safer bet. </p>
					<h3>Windows 7 Compatibility:</h3>
					<p>RNAstructure is Windows 7 compatible. Prior versions of RNAstructure required the user to run in &quot;Windows XP Compatibility Mode,&quot; but that requirement is removed.</p>
					<h3>Running on Windows 8:</h3>
					<p>RNAstructure is now  Windows 8 compatible. An update was uploaded on 5/16/2013 to make the version 5.5 compatible.</p>
